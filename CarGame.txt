^^^ I used this website to help create the car that was used in my project.
It also gave me tips on how to set up the camera

all of the other elements implemented in the game were thought up by myself or I used
information that I learned from lectures and labs.

The game is a car driving game where you avoid walls and collect coins.
the coins add to your score, colliding with the walls ends the game.

You can also complete the game once you have been driving long enough.
It will then show you your score and prompt you to restart the game.

I recommend not playing this game in full screen. It zooms in on the car too much
